     <p><font color ="indianred"> Movie theaters are finally opening back up again! After a long wait of closed theaters due to the pandemic, we can slowly start returning back to the things we enjoy again. 
        With everyone staying home and watching films on their tv or other devices, the theater experience was missed by many, but now it's time to relive that.</p> 
    <p>Movie Time offers the newest and upcoming films not only in full high definition, but in IMAX as well. Get ready to take a break from reality by entering that dark room to laugh, cry, and enjoy new films on a big screen amongst other movie goers. Feel free to check out the schedule for the month, buy tickets, and exclusive merch from our store!</p>
